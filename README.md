# Damped Oscillator Visualization

This web application provides an interactive visualization of a damped oscillator. Users can dynamically adjust parameters such as amplitude, frequency, and damping ratio to observe the real-time changes in the behavior of the damped oscillator.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph:** Real-time visualization of the damped oscillator's motion.
- **Adjustable Parameters:** Control amplitude, frequency, and damping ratio.
- **Educational Content:** Key concepts and mathematical model explained in the right section.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Adjust the input values for amplitude, frequency, and damping ratio.
3. Observe the real-time changes in the damped oscillator graph.
